# XD-Persona-template
I use this Adobe XD template file for creating Persona's. 

For use with UX Design Project. The Color Scheme is made and edited in Adobe XD. This way each color will be easaly changed to any color withing the picture you add. The Image in the XD file is masked and therefore its a dropin update!
